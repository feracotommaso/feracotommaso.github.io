SEB skills—people’s capacities to regulate emotions, build relationships, engage socially, innovate, and manage goals—are theoretically distinct from personality traits. Whereas traits capture how individuals typically behave, SEB skills reflect what people are capable of doing when a situation requires it. Yet, existing measurement tools have struggled to fully reflect this distinction.\nThe original BESSI (Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory) provided the first comprehensive framework to assess 32 SEB skill facets grouped into five domains, and showed strong psychometric properties across languages and cultural contexts. Our Italian validation study (BESSI-I) confirmed the robustness of the framework, demonstrating excellent reliability, solid factorial validity, and meaningful links with personality traits and relevant outcomes such as self-efficacy, procrastination, and emotion regulation.\nHowever, across international studies, self-reported SEB skills remained strongly correlated with Big Five traits—raising questions about discriminant validity and individuals’ ability to distinguish tendencies from capacities in questionnaire formats.\nTo address this, the project introduces and evaluates the BESSI-R, a refined measurement tool designed to better separate SEB skills from personality traits.

    "section": "",
    "text": "During our Structural Equation Modeling course, we teach PhD students a simple but deceptively powerful fact about predictive validity in multiple regression. Imagine a single latent variable—call it racial attitudes—that predicts a behavioral outcome such as discriminatory behaviors. Now imagine that we have two different measures of this latent variable, for example an explicit self-report and an implicit reaction-time task.\nStudents often assume that if we regress the behavioral outcome on both the explicit and implicit measures simultaneously, the resulting regression coefficients tell us “which one is the better predictor”, but they also expect both effects will be zero because we are ‘controlling’ for the same thing. But both these intuitions are mistaken. If both measures load on the same underlying latent construct, then both will almost always be statistically significant in a large enough sample, even if neither has any unique predictive effect. The coefficients simply reflect their relative loadings on the same latent cause.\nThis is not a subtle point: it is a foundational implication of classical test theory and the logic of multiple regression. If we want to know whether either measure has incremental validity, we must first model and remove the influence of their common latent factor. Otherwise the incremental effect is an artifact of confounding.\nDon’t believe it? Here is a quick simulation to prove the point.\nWe start by simulating our latent variable (racial attitudes):\n\n# Imagine we have a sample size of N participants\nN = 1000\n# Our latent unobservable variable, is a normally-distributed\n# variable with mean 0 and sd 1\nlatent &lt;- rnorm(N, 0, 1)\n\nWe assume this latent variable to have an effect on Y (discriminatory behaviors). The unstandardized effect is 0.33:\n\n# Our dependent variable is again a normally-distributed\n# variable, partially explained by 'latent'\nY = .33*latent + rnorm(N, 0, 1)\n\nThe latent variable and Y are now correlated around .30:\n\nround(cor(latent,Y),2)\n\n[1] 0.32\n\n\nHowever, we cannot measure the latent variable directly. We need to build a questionnaire/test/paradigm that allows measuring and observing that construct. We build two of them, one explicit, with a higher loading, and one implicit, with a smaller loading. Let’s do it:\n\n# Explicit is just regressed on the latent variable\n# To have a higher loading we multiply latent by .8\nexplicit = .80*latent + rnorm(N,0,1)\n\n# Impicit is the same, but with smaller loading (.5)\nimplicit = .50*latent + rnorm(N,0,1)\n\nWe now have our data collection: we observed the dependent variable, and the two observed indicators of the latent variable [Note that none of them has any specific effect on Y!, We simulated it like this]. What happens if we test their multiple associations with Y?\n\nY=scale(Y);explicit=scale(explicit);implicit=scale(implicit)\nfit &lt;- lm(Y ~ explicit + implicit)\nround(summary(fit)$coefficients,3)\n\n            Estimate Std.

They can easily emerge when both predictors share variance due to an underlying latent trait—even if there are no specific effects at all. This was nicely explained by Julia Rohrer in her October 2025 blogpost, and has been know since many years (e.g., Westfall and Yarkoni 2016).\n\nBut this is not just a didactic issue.

    "text": "Reanalyzing Axt and colleagues’ dataset\nThe recent paper ‘On the relationship between indirect measures of Black vs. White racial attitudes and discriminatory outcomes: An adversarial collaboration using a sample of White Americans’ represents one of the largest and methodologically strongest empirical efforts in the history of implicit bias research. With over 2,100 White American participants, four implicit measures, four explicit measures, four behavioral tasks, and a preregistered SEM framework, it looks—at first glance—like the definitive test the field has been waiting for.\nTheir headline finding is clear:\n\nImplicit attitudes predict discriminatory behavior, and they explain ~2.5% of the variance beyond explicit attitudes.\n\nBut here is the crucial problem: the model they fit assumes that implicit and explicit attitudes are separate causes of discriminatory behavior. The SEM explicitly excludes the possibility that both sets of indicators reflect a single underlying general attitude factor—an exremely plausible scenario in this case (Schimmack 2021) and exactly the scenario our simulation demonstrates.\nIndeed, the entire model in the published paper (see Figure 1 and the lavaan syntax below) implies that:\n\nThere is a latent implicit factor,\nA separate latent explicit factor,\nAnd both compete to predict latent discriminant behavior.\n\nWhat is missing is the latent general racial attitude factor that would naturally give rise to shared variance across both implicit and explicit methods (which are highly correlated). If such a factor exists—and there are strong theoretical, empirical, and psychometric reasons to believe it does—then their incremental validity claim could collapse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Published SEM model\n\n\n\n\nmodel_A &lt;- '\n  # measurement model\n    implicit =~ iat + sciat + amp + ept\n    explicit =~ anes + dpm + pi + srs\n    discrim =~ ug + tg + jbt + ret\n  # paths\n    discrim ~ implicit + explicit\n  # residual correlations\n    anes ~~ srs\n    dpm ~~ pi\n'\n\nSo what happens if we add that general latent factor?\nWhen we implement a hierarchical model—one general attitude factor plus the specific method factors—we get good fit (CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.03, SRMR = 0.03) but a radically different picture Figure 2:\n\nThe general attitude factor significantly predicts discriminatory behavior (β ≈ 0.15).\nThe explicit-specific factor still predicts behavior strongly (β ≈ 0.60).\nThe implicit-specific factor shows no meaningful unique relationship with discrimination (β ≈ .09, p = .23).\n\nThis is the model we should have tested from the beginning. And once we do, the “incremental validity” of implicit measures disappears.\n\nmodel_A &lt;- '\n  # measurement model\n    implicit =~ iat + sciat + amp + ept\n    explicit =~ anes + dpm + pi + srs\n    general =~ implicit + explicit\n    discrim =~ ug + tg + jbt + ret\n  # paths\n    discrim ~ implicit + explicit + general\n  # residual correlations\n    anes ~~ srs\n    dpm ~~ pi\n'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The adjusted hierarchical model"

(e.g., GMM may show inflated Type I error under modest skewness)\nEstimate Power\nHow often does the method correctly detect two clusters when they truly exist? (e.g., with d = .50 and N = 700, power is extremely low for both GMM and k-means)\nAssess classification accuracy\nUsing the Adjusted Rand Index, the app reveals how often detected clusters actually match the true underlying structure (k-means may detect “two clusters” with 100% power but classify individuals no better than chance (Adjusted Rand Index ≈ .06))."

    "text": "What This Project Does\nAcross multiple studies, this research program examines:\n\nMean-level differences in SEB skills between students with and without SLDs.\nHow SEB skills relate to outcomes such as academic achievement, life satisfaction, peer acceptance, academic burnout, and engagement.\nWhy SEB skills may function differently for students with SLDs, with a particular focus on self-regulated learning processes.\nHow these findings generalize, via preregistered replications and meta-analytic synthesis.\n\nTogether, these studies build a coherent picture of the strengths and vulnerabilities of students with SLDs in non-academic domains—an essential step for designing more inclusive and strength-based educational practices."

    "section": "Key Findings",
    "text": "Key Findings\n\nStudents with SLDs show a consistently weaker SEB profile\nAcross multiple datasets—including more than 5,000 students—students with SLDs tend to report lower Self-management, Cooperation, and Social Engagement skills. These effects are small but highly consistent across studies and educational levels.\nHigher SEB skills do not guarantee better grades for students with SLDs\nWhile Self-management skills are reliably associated with higher academic achievement among students without SLDs, these associations are weak or absent in the SLD group.\nThis pattern replicates across independent samples.\nSEB skills remain important for well-being\nDespite the weakened link with achievement, SEB skills are similarly associated with life satisfaction and other non-academic outcomes (e.g., peer acceptance) in both groups.\nVulnerabilities extend beyond learning\nStudents with SLDs also report lower academic self-efficacy, weaker self-regulated learning strategies, and higher burnout risk, especially at the university level.\n\n\n\n\nA mini meta-analysis of the first three studies we conducted"

    "section": "Why This Matters",
    "text": "Why This Matters\nThis project contributes to reframing SLDs within a broader developmental perspective, recognizing that:\n\nLearning disabilities diagnoses affect more than academic performance—they shape emotional and social adjustment as well.\nSEB skills represent crucial personal resources, but students with SLDs may struggle to apply them effectively in academic contexts.\nInterventions should address both skill development and the structural barriers that prevent students with SLDs from translating these skills into achievement.\n\nThese findings support strength-based, inclusive, and multi-level approaches in schools and universities.."
