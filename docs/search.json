    "text": "The Living SEB Project responds to a growing challenge in SEB research: the expected rapid proliferation of studies adopting the SEB framework and the BESSI measures, which risks creating fragmentation, selective reporting, and conceptual confusion. The project addresses this challenge by building a living, open-science infrastructure that continually integrates new evidence and makes it accessible to the research community.\nThe project includes ongoing systematic literature searches, a centralized and openly available database of coded study metadata and effect sizes, and an interactive web application that allows users to run customizable meta-analyses, extract data, and generate reproducible reports. This living approach ensures that evidence is updated regularly and that users always have access to the most current state of the field.\nThe resource also includes demonstration analyses, such as meta-analytic estimates of associations between SEB skill domains and academic achievement, and a meta-analytic structural equation model examining the incremental validity of SEB skills beyond personality traits. These examples illustrate how the database can support complex modeling and theory testing.\nConceptually, the project is grounded in the understanding of SEB skills as capacities—what people are capable of doing when required—distinguishing them from more stable personality traits. The skills are organized into five broad domains: Innovation, Self-Management, Social Engagement, Cooperation, and Emotional Resilience.\nAims of the project\n\nTo provide a comprehensive, up-to-date map of SEB skills research across different populations, settings, and outcomes.\nTo enable cumulative, transparent, and reproducible evidence synthesis through standardized meta-analytic tools and openly accessible data.\nTo help consolidate the SEB skills framework, reduce conceptual fragmentation, and guide future empirical and applied work based on the full available evidence.\n\nBecause the database is updated regularly, the Living SEB Project remains responsive to the ongoing flow of new studies. Users can filter research by population, design, outcomes, or instruments; run their own analyses; and export data and code for further work, preregistrations, or replications."

While school anxiety is known to affect mental health and academic achievement, recent evidence shows that these effects are far from uniform. Using population-level data from millions of Italian 5th grade students and linking these data to precise geographical locations, the project examines where school anxiety is more prevalent and where it is most harmful.\nGPS-A integrates educational psychology, geographical psychology, and environmental data to uncover the socio-ecological features—such as green spaces, climate, pollution, population density, and economic inequality—that help explain this variability. Through advanced spatial analyses and large-scale intervention studies that will be conducted across 50 diverse regions, the project tests whether the effectiveness of psychological interventions also changes depending on the local environment.\nBy developing the first fine-grained geographical model of school anxiety, GPS-A aims to support more context-sensitive theories, improve school-based interventions, and provide policymakers with evidence to better allocate resources.

(e.g., GMM may show inflated Type I error under modest skewness)\nEstimate Power\nHow often does the method correctly detect two clusters when they truly exist? (e.g., with d = .50 and N = 700, power is extremely low for both GMM and k-means)\nAssess classification accuracy\nUsing the Adjusted Rand Index, the app reveals how often detected clusters actually match the true underlying structure (k-means may detect “two clusters” with 100% power but classify individuals no better than chance (Adjusted Rand Index ≈ .06))."

    "text": "This umbrella project investigates how social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills develop, how young people, adults, and professionals think about changing these skills, and what motivates intentional personal development of SEB skills. SEB skills—such as self-management, cooperation, innovation, social engagement, and emotional resilience—play a central role in well-being, academic success, and social functioning. They represent individuals’ capacity to activate effective behaviors when situations require them, distinguishing them from more stable personality traits.\nAcross multiple studies, this project addresses three interconnected questions:\n\nHow do SEB skills change across developmental periods?\nResearch including large samples of adolescents and adults shows that SEB skills follow distinct age-related patterns and sometimes gender-specific trajectories, highlighting periods of natural growth and periods of vulnerability where certain skills decline and may require support.\nWhat do adolescents, parents, teachers, and other professionals believe about the possibility of changing personal characteristics?\nMulti-informant studies reveal that all groups see SEB skills as more feasible and desirable to change than personality traits. Teachers, in particular, strongly prefer skill-based development pathways, whereas students show more modest but consistent preferences—especially in domains linked to social engagement.\nHow do individuals prioritize change goals, and what shapes their motivation?\nExperimental work with young adults shows that people often report higher motivation, stronger perceived impact, and greater feasibility in changing SEB skills compared to their associated traits—especially in domains like self-management and social engagement. This suggests that skill-based framing may be a powerful route for personal development and intervention design.\n\nTogether, I aim to support a comprehensive understanding of SEB skills, their natural development, their associated change goals and beliefs, and their role in volitional change. The project combines developmental psychology, personality science, motivation research, and educational practice to identify when and how SEB skills can be effectively supported—both through natural growth and through structured interventions."

    "text": "Accurately assessing social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills is a central challenge in this field. SEB skills—people’s capacities to regulate emotions, build relationships, engage socially, innovate, and manage goals—are theoretically distinct from personality traits. Whereas traits capture how individuals typically behave, SEB skills reflect what people are capable of doing when a situation requires it. Yet, existing measurement tools have struggled to fully reflect this distinction.\nThe original BESSI (Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory) provided the first comprehensive framework to assess 32 SEB skill facets grouped into five domains, and showed strong psychometric properties across languages and cultural contexts. Our Italian validation study (BESSI-I) confirmed the robustness of the framework, demonstrating excellent reliability, solid factorial validity, and meaningful links with personality traits and relevant outcomes such as self-efficacy, procrastination, and emotion regulation.\nHowever, across international studies, self-reported SEB skills remained strongly correlated with Big Five traits—raising questions about discriminant validity and individuals’ ability to distinguish tendencies from capacities in questionnaire formats.\nTo address this, the project introduces and evaluates the BESSI-R, a refined measurement tool designed to better separate SEB skills from personality traits. The BESSI-R includes:\n\nclearer conceptual instructions distinguishing abilities from tendencies,\na dual-item format, asking first about behavioral tendencies and then about abilities,\nan expanded response scale for finer discrimination, and\nsmall but targeted wording adjustments to facilitate more accurate self-assessment.\n\nInitial evidence from high school students shows that participants do perceive items about skills and tendencies as meaningfully different, report different scores for each, and show improved differentiation between skills and traits. The BESSI-R retains the strong psychometric structure of the original BESSI while yielding lower skill–trait correlations, stronger incremental validity for predicting key academic and socio-emotional outcomes, and meaningful convergence with parent-reported skills.\nTogether, the BESSI-I and BESSI-R projects aim to advance the conceptual and empirical foundations of SEB skill assessment by:\n\nvalidating the SEB skills framework across languages and developmental periods,\nimproving the measurement tools used to distinguish skills from traits, and\nsupporting more precise research, applied work, and educational interventions based on SEB skills.\n\nThis broader research program contributes to building a reliable, culturally adaptable, and theoretically coherent assessment system for SEB skills—one that respects their conceptual specificity, captures their malleability, and enables stronger scientific and practical applications."
