It provides a transparent, continuously updated interface to examine study characteristics, extract effect sizes, and run reproducible analyses in real time.\nBuilt as part of a broader effort to create a living, open, and cumulative evidence base on Social, Emotional, and Behavioral skills (SEB), the app allows researchers, students, and practitioners to interact with the data without needing to write any R code.\n➡️ Access the app here: https://feracoshiny.shinyapps.io/livingSEBapp/{target=“_blank”}"

(e.g., GMM may show inflated Type I error under modest skewness)\nEstimate Power\nHow often does the method correctly detect two clusters when they truly exist? (e.g., with d = .50 and N = 700, power is extremely low for both GMM and k-means)\nAssess classification accuracy\nUsing the Adjusted Rand Index, the app reveals how often detected clusters actually match the true underlying structure (k-means may detect “two clusters” with 100% power but classify individuals no better than chance (Adjusted Rand Index ≈ .06))."

The manuscript shows several scenarios where:\n\nModerate skewness (skew = .50) yields 48% false positives for GMM in our simulation (p.7)\nModest correlations (r = .35) produce 100% false positives for k-means (p.8–9)\nLarge sample sizes exacerbate the problem for GMM (p.12)\nGMM may “create” clusters to compensate for skewed distributions (Figure 6, p.13)\n\nThese are exactly the pitfalls the app helps users explore and understand."
