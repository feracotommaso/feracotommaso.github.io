## Overview

The **Living SEB Project** (<https://github.com/feracotommaso/living_SEB_review>) is an open, continuously updated research initiative that compiles and synthesizes all available **cross-sectional studies** on Strength–Emotion–Behavior (SEB) associations.\
Its goal is to create a transparent, reproducible, and dynamic evidence base that evolves as new research emerges.

The project provides access to a *living database*, a suite of analytic tools, a public preregistration, and a detailed methodological paper explaining the full workflow. It is designed to support researchers, students, and meta-analysts who need reliable, continually updated evidence from the SEB literature.

## What the project includes

-   **A curated, living database** of SEB studies
-   **Fully reproducible effect-size extraction pipeline**
-   **A continuously updated synthesis** of SEB associations
-   **Interactive tools** for exploring and analysing the evidence
-   **Open access materials** including preregistrations, papers, and presentations

## Why a “Living” approach?

Traditional meta-analyses quickly become outdated as new studies accumulate.\
The Living SEB Project uses a *living evidence* workflow — an approach that ensures:

-   rapid integration of new findings
-   fully reproducible synthesis pipelines
-   transparent tracking of updates
-   continuous availability of up-to-date results

This allows the SEB literature to remain **current, cumulative, and open** for researchers and practitioners.
