## Overview

This Shiny app provides an interactive interface to explore the results of our meta-analysis on the associations between **character strengths** and **well-being** and **common mental health disorders** (Casali & Feraco, 2025).\
It allows users to navigate effect sizes, compare outcomes, and inspect forest, funnel, and caterpillar plots for each of the 24 VIA strengths.

➡️ **Launch the app:**\
<https://feracoshiny.shinyapps.io/character-meta-v3/>

➡️ **More information on the meta-analysis:**\
<https://doi.org/10.1177/08902070251366765>

## What you can do

-   Browse meta-analytic correlations for each of the 24 character strengths
-   Compare associations across **well-being** and **mental health** outcomes
-   Explore patterns of heterogeneity and prediction intervals
-   Visualize results through interactive plots
-   Access summary tables and effect-size information

The app is meant as a practical complement to the manuscript, enabling readers, students, and researchers to examine the results dynamically and intuitively.
