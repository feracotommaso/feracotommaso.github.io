## Overview

**Clusters That Are Not There** is a Shiny application designed to help researchers **quantify inferential risks** when applying clustering methods such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) or k-means. Inspired by the article *Clusters That Are Not There* (Toffalini et al., 2024), the app provides an accessible interface to run Monte Carlo simulations that evaluate **Type I error**, **power**, and **classification accuracy** under conditions commonly found in psychological research.

The core message of the paper is simple but crucial:

**Clustering methods can easily “detect” clusters even when none exist — especially when assumptions such as normality or local independence are violated.**\
This app offers an intuitive way to test these risks *before* running cluster analyses on real data.

## What the App Does

The app implements the simulation logic described in the manuscript, allowing users to:

-   **Simulate datasets** with custom characteristics:
    -   sample size
    -   number of indicators
    -   correlations
    -   skewness and kurtosis
    -   effect size (d) between true clusters
-   **Estimate Type I error**\
    How often does a method detect multiple clusters when the data truly come from **one population**? (e.g., GMM may show inflated Type I error under modest skewness)
-   **Estimate Power**\
    How often does the method correctly detect two clusters when they truly exist? (e.g., with d = .50 and N = 700, power is extremely low for both GMM and k-means)
-   **Assess classification accuracy**\
    Using the Adjusted Rand Index, the app reveals how often detected clusters actually match the true underlying structure (k-means may detect “two clusters” with 100% power but *classify individuals no better than chance* (Adjusted Rand Index ≈ .06)).

## Why This Matters

Clustering is popular in psychology, but the assumptions behind common methods are often unmet. The manuscript shows several scenarios where:

-   **Moderate skewness** (skew = .50) yields **48% false positives** for GMM in our simulation (p.7)
-   **Modest correlations** (r = .35) produce **100% false positives** for k-means (p.8–9)
-   **Large sample sizes** exacerbate the problem for GMM (p.12)
-   **GMM may “create” clusters** to compensate for skewed distributions (Figure 6, p.13)

These are exactly the pitfalls the app helps users explore and understand.
